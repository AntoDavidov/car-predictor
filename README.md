# 🚗 Car Brand Classifier – BMW vs Audi vs Mercedes

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning model that classifies images of cars as **BMW**, **Audi**, or **Mercedes-Benz** based on full-car photos (not just logos). It uses deep learning (CNNs and transfer learning) to learn visual features from real-world car images, making it suitable for mobile or web-based applications.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Type:** Image Classification (Multi-class)
- **Classes:** BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz
- **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras
- **Goal:** Given a photo of a car, predict whether it is a BMW, Audi, or Mercedes-Benz.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A dataset of car images is collected manually from the internet.
2. The images are cleaned and resized for uniformity.
3. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built using **transfer learning** (MobileNetV2).
4. The model is trained and validated on the dataset.
5. The trained model is used to classify new car images.

## 🖼️ Dataset

The dataset consists of manually collected images of three brands:

- **BMW**  
- **Audi**  
- **Mercedes-Benz**

Images were gathered from Google Images, car dealership websites, and forums. Each folder should contain a variety of models and angles (front, side, rear).

Due to size and licensing constraints, the dataset is **not included in this repository**. You can recreate the dataset by following this structure:

/dataset
    /audi
    audi1.jpg
...
    /bmw
    bmw1.jpg
...
    /mercedes
    mercedes1.jpg
